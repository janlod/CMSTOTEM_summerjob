# General remarks:
- Cuts are too strong, insignificant statistics. We should aim for about 500k events after all cuts
# Next steps:
	- Create 2D scatter plot of reconstr. invariant mass (based on pions) put one pairing vs. other pairing on axis.
	- We expect something going on around 770 MeV (rho mass) broader distribution and around 500 MeV (K0 mass) narrower distribution
	- In general relax cuts a little bit and compare kept and thrown away events, for example we expect discarded events(Most likely K0 pairs) to have broader trk\_dxy and trk\_dz distr. since they are secondary particles.
	- Once scatter plot works properly select events around K0 and rho peak (around 2 sigma of mean) and compare number of events --> ratio of #events could be metric for optimisation.
