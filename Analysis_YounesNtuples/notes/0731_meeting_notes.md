# Remarks
- Glueball invariant mass plot looks remarkably unremarkable, improvement of cuts is needed
- Should look at numerical values of $\chi^2\_m$ when comparing, check if they are similar
- 2D correlation plot of $\chi^2$ for the 2 pairing to check that
- Check px and py correlation of cutted 4trk system and proton px and py in roman pots
- Reconstruct pt and eta for cutted 4trk system, we expect low pt and |eta|<1 or 1.5
