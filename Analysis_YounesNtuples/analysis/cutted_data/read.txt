For cutting the data:
* All events with ntrk=4
* All events with |eta|<1.5
* All events within 3 sigma of zPV, dxy/dxyerr, dz/dzerr distribution
* For dxy_phi and dz_eta for each slice we make a fit and then also only if within 3 sigma

Reduced total number of events roughly from 1 million to 250,000
