Tracks in CMS Tracker:
    • Study z_vertex distribution in 4-track events, outliers? --> necessary to remove some events with badly reconstructed vertex? (3-4sigma of distribution)?
    • Study x_vertex and y_vertex (alternatively r_vertex = sqrt(x_vertex^2 + y_vertex^2)) distribution in 4-track events, outliers or structures due to conversions --> necessary to remove some events coming from conversions/long-living particles (K^0_s)/badly reconstructed vertices? (3-4sigma of distribution)?
    • Study dz distribution in 4-track events, any systematic vs eta?--> require dz of all particles in the event to be less that 3-4sigma of distribution? 
    • Study dz/sigma_dz distribution in 4-track events. Use dz uncertainties and verify whether the dz/sigma_dz follows a gaussian distribution 
    • Study dxy distribution in 4-track events, any systematic vs phi? -->  require dxy of all particles in the event to be less that 3-4sigma of distribution? 
    • Study dxy/sigma_dxy distribution in 4-track events. Use dxy uncertainties and verify whether the dxy/sigma_dxy follows a gaussian distribution. 
    • Study “loopers” in events in 4 tracks by checking |p_i + p_j| /m_pi -->  “loopers” should make a peak at zero in |p_i + p_j| /m_pi ? Choose a cut separating loopers and good tracks (|p_i + p_j| /m_pi exponentially increasing distribution from zero) and remove events with loopers with that cut.
    • Study sigma_p/p in 4-track events -->  necessary to remove some events with badly reconstructed tracks?
Protons in RP:
    • Implement Ferenc proton reconstruction and RP alignment -->  check whether proton-track matching improved
    • Check that LHC optics used in the best one from Frici
    • Events containing elastic protons? Study px and py sums of protons only, elastic events should peak at zero in both distributions. If events have p sums close to zero in both projections, then enforce cut to remove such events.
    • Study vertex position at IP reconstructed by RPs in left (L) and right (R) arm: x_L* vs x_R* and y_L* vs y_R*, outliers? -->  necessary to remove some events badly reconstructed vertex from the protons (corresponding to events with high proton momentum loss?)? (3-4sigma of distribution)? 
    • Study reconstructed proton momentum loss (xi). Are there protons that seems to have a significant momentum loss? 
       Study event matching
    • Study px sum of protons vs px sum of tracks, cuts appropriate?
    • Study py sum of protons vs py sum of tracks, cuts appropriate?
    • Study pT distribution for the sum of the p’s of tracks (done per component). 
    • Study eta distribution for the sum of the p’s of tracks (done per component).
Check phi and rho reconstruction after improved track, proton and event selection
    • Study 2-track invariant mass vs 2-track invariant mass distributions with pion and kaon hypothesis
    • Check whether rho and phi invariant masses and widths are at their nominal values or not 
    • Select rho and phi candidates using experimental invariant masses and widths (1-2 sigma).
